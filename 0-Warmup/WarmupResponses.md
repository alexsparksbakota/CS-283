5. Briefly describe what you want to get out of this class.

   I hope to gain more insight on a machine's hardware's inner workings. I feel as though I have yet to be exposed to this side of computer science in my current studies.

7. Briefly describe any concerns you might be having with being successful in this class (if any).

   I am slightly concerned about not having taken the CS 281 course that has been briefly mentioned, but offered some extra review I am confident that I will be properly equipped for the course.
